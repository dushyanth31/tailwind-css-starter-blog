> Arguing That You Don’t Care About the Right to Privacy because You have Nothing to Hide, is No Different than Saying you don’t Care about Free Speech because you have Nothing to Say. – Edward Snowden

## Introduction

We have all heard the term "**Big Brother**" from George Orwell's 1984, which represents an all-seeing, all-knowing authority figure who constantly monitors and controls the population. The Big Brother concept focuses on three things: spying, collecting, and exploiting. Additionally, the term "**The Big Three**" refers to Privacy, Security, and Anonymity. The Big Three are not always interdependent. There may be situations where we have Security without Privacy or Anonymity, or Security and Privacy without Anonymity, etc.

## Privacy

> "Privacy- like eating and breathing-is one of life's basic requirements". -Katherine Neville

`Privacy` is “the state of being apart from observation or not disturbed by other people.” It is a ability to control information and own it. This typically refers to information about your identity, like your metadata.

Privacy is a fundamental human right and is essential for the protection of personal freedom.

Privacy is like a house. Most people do not want to live in a house completely made out of glass. Data privacy should be viewed in a similar fashion, data shouldn’t be a “Glass House”.

Using the above house example, privacy can be thought of as your ability to control who has the key or the address to your house.

In the digital age, protecting privacy online has become increasingly important, as more and more personal information is shared and stored online.
