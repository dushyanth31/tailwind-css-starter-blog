We are living in the age of Information. Where DATA would be the new oil. Every corporation and Big Tech companies are preying for our data without our consent. The world's most [valuable brands](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/top-100-most-valuable-brands-in-2022/) were of course, everyone knows it, were Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, all companies notorious for their data collection and targeted-advertising. All these were Tech companies, Who had become a Multi billion dollar by simply selling our data to infinite advertisers.

For example, Google doesn't respect your privacy - every interaction with Google services is recorded, logged, and used to tailor ads for you, saved for future usage, sold to their party companies, or even sold to government agencies., Almost 90% of Googleâ€™s revenue is derived from advertising.

Many people are familiar with targeted advertising, but they don't pay much attention to it. They think it's good to see ads that are relevant to them. However, they don't realise the negative impact of the methods companies use to collect data and how it can harm people.

Well, it may sound strange, but all of these statements are true. These [giants](https://bernardmarr.com/where-can-you-buy-big-data-here-are-the-biggest-consumer-data-brokers/) in the data industry are [harvesting](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/data-brokers-tracking/) our data and building profiles on us that go beyond our imagination. They are tracking our every move and activity, and using it to build a [detailed picture](https://duo.com/labs/research/data-companies-are-watching-me#top) of [who we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Swqc2NjEXM), what we do, and what we like. This information is then sold to companies for various purposes such as targeted advertising, market research, and more.

Furthermore, the giants in the data industry are [using our data against us](https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/1064/invisible-manipulation-10-ways-our-data-being-used-against-us) and exploiting it. To give an idea of the extent of the abuses, financial services are issuing loans based on an individual's social network as PageRank of people, the contents of a person's smartphone, including who and when you call and receive messages, what apps are on the device, location data, and more. Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used millions of Facebook users' data to build psychological profiles, is just one example of how data can be misused. This is not the only example of how our data is being misused, there are many other examples out there.
