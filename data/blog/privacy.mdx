## Introduction:

Fundamental questions arise on whether we truly require privacy. One might question the necessity of privacy, thinking, “Why would someone like me need to hide something? Am I a criminal or a celebrity?”. However, there are genuine reasons why anyone should be entitled to confidentiality, regardless of their status. Privacy is a fundamental right and a matter of personal liberty. As privacy activists assert, it's about "liberty versus control". Liberty requires security without intrusion, security plus privacy.

We are living in the age of Information. Where DATA would be the new oil. Every corporation and Big Tech companies are preying for our data without our consent. The world's most [valuable brands](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/top-100-most-valuable-brands-in-2022/) were of course, everyone knows it, were Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, all companies notorious for their data collection and targeted-advertising. All these were Tech companies, Who had become a Multi billion dollar by simply selling our data to infinite advertisers.

For example, Google doesn't respect your privacy - every interaction with Google services is recorded, logged, and used to tailor ads for you, saved for future usage, sold to their party companies, or even sold to government agencies., Almost 90% of Google’s revenue is derived from advertising.

Many people are familiar with targeted advertising, but they don't pay much attention to it. They think it's good to see ads that are relevant to them. However, they don't realise the negative impact of the methods companies use to collect data and how it can harm people.

Well, it may sound strange, but all of these statements are true. These [giants](https://bernardmarr.com/where-can-you-buy-big-data-here-are-the-biggest-consumer-data-brokers/) in the data industry are [harvesting](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/data-brokers-tracking/) our data and building profiles on us that go beyond our imagination. They are tracking our every move and activity, and using it to build a [detailed picture](https://duo.com/labs/research/data-companies-are-watching-me#top) of [who we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Swqc2NjEXM), what we do, and what we like. This information is then sold to companies for various purposes such as targeted advertising, market research, and more.

Furthermore, the giants in the data industry are [using our data against us](https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/1064/invisible-manipulation-10-ways-our-data-being-used-against-us) and exploiting it. To give an idea of the extent of the abuses, financial services are issuing loans based on an individual's social network as PageRank of people, the contents of a person's smartphone, including who and when you call and receive messages, what apps are on the device, location data, and more. Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used millions of Facebook users' data to build psychological profiles, is just one example of how data can be misused. This is not the only example of how our data is being misused, there are many other examples out there.

`Why Care About Privacy:`

-   In depth article about advertiser tracking at [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/im-being-followed-how-google-151-and-104-other-companies-151-are-tracking-me-on-the-web/253758/) and when all this data is combined, it can be used for building very complete profiles on individuals.
-   Tracking services were watching the entirety of your behavior on the Web. Seems funny?. You can check out this [awesome tool](https://portfolio.toolness.org/collusion/) to understand it.
-   Privacy protects fundamental rights: [Privacy](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html) is not just about hiding something illegal or unethical, but also protects fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and thought, and the right to personal autonomy.
    
-   Information can be misinterpreted or used against you: Personal information can be misinterpreted, taken out of context, or used to make [false assumptions](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/google-facebook-surveillance-capitalism-personal-data-cola/) about someone.
    
-   Cambridge Analytica scandal: The Cambridge Analytica scandal involved the unauthorized harvesting of Facebook users' data for political advertising purposes, showing how personal information can be misused.
-   Facebook privacy controversies: Facebook has been embroiled in several privacy controversies in recent years, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the revelation that Facebook had allowed third-party apps to collect users' personal information without their knowledge or consent. Additionally, Facebook does't give damn about your [mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/365nja/why_you_should_delete_your_facebook/).
-   Mass surveillance programs: Government mass surveillance programs, such as the US National Security Agency's [PRISM](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data) program, have raised concerns about privacy violations and the potential for abuse of power. No matter where you are, the NSA can monitor you, and your country's intelligence agency may also have surveillance programs.
    
-   The Pentagon's $59 billion [black budget](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/black-budget/) is allocated to the CIA, NSA, and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which receive more than 68% of the budget.

With all the above points and explanations, if you still think it's okay to give away your privacy, then you have underestimated the value it holds. If you have truly understood the value of privacy, then in the upcoming posts, we will see how to protect it and so on.
